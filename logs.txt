What is the current flow of the project? 




client --> init websocket connection. 
first conn.Write() is the byte slice of the public key. 


server --> scans for connection --> finds a connection. --> first read should be stored in struct map. 


in order to store in the map. it will be string(pubkey) --> ws.Conn object


next steps. make sure the server first read will be stored into the map.
